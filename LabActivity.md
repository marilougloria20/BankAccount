## Add Functionality

To add functionality to the `BankAccount` class,
create a new method called `send_money` that takes in two parameters:
 - a recipient BankAccount object; and
 - an amount to be transferred.

The method should facilitate the transfer of money from the calling account to the recipient account.

Example usage:
```php
$account1->send_money($account2, 10000);
```

which transfers 10000 from `$account1` to `$account2`.

## Design Web Form
Create a web form to easily demonstrate the `BankAccount` features.
